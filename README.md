## Zephyr CLI
This is a project I started to expierpment more with [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). The main file are 100% [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) suggestions with only very little modifications.

# It's simple!
Just run ```zephyr``` in your favorite terminal!

## Intructions
```bash
$ yarn install
```
# OR
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm i -g .
```
